# CS40 - Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming
This repository contains all of my projects for CS40. This class was an incredible amount of C coding, in which we heavily relied on *Hanson's Interfaces and Implementations*. We also read and wrote code in assembly language.

## Projects
- ```files-of-pix``` - Decorrupting pgm image files
- ```iii```          - Solving sudoku and removing black edges from images
- ```locality```     - Geometric transformations of images using different methods to see effects of caching and locality
- ```arith```        - Compressing images using low level bit manipulation
- ```bomb```         - Defusing a 'bomb' by reading through AMD64 assembly code
- ```um```           - Emulating the universal machine
- ```profile```      - Making our UM as fast as possible
- ```umasm```        - implementing a RPN calculator in the UM's assembly language

## Reflection
Biggest Takeaways - Gaining massive amounts of experience programming in C, as well as learning the importance of extensive planning before doing any coding

Favorite Project        - ```um```

Proudest Accomplishment - being 12% faster than the reference for ```profile```
