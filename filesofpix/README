recieved help from TAs Lexi and Dan

- known errors are that when a correct line is at the last row of a file, it is 
read in by the decorrupt function but it does not get added to the sequence; 
(it still will excecute properly, the resulting image will just be missing that
last line of data.)
- Additionally, readaline can not handle lines of greater than
1000 chars. 
- All other functions seem to be implemented correctly
